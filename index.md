Thank you for visiting our site.

## Welcome to Folly Beach Baptist Church!

We are so excited that you are here. We are a fellowship of Christ followers who are committed to:

**Reaching** Everyone with the Gospel (Romans 1:16)  
**Raising** Believers in the Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16-17)  
**Releasing** the Church to Change the World (Matthew 28:18-20)

Folly Beach is known as the _Edge of America_. However, the message of the Gospel does not stop on
the shores of the Atlantic Ocean or the doors of the church. Our motto is, _From the Edge of America
to the ends of the earth!_ â€“ Jesus

We are blessed to be located at Folly Beach - a popular vacation destination and the beach of choice
for many Lowcountry locals. The church here, like the surrounding area, is relaxed and full of
southern hospitality. Come just like you are. You do not have to get dressed up. Everyone is welcome
here! It would be a blessing to us to have you join us in person. If you cannot be here in person,
you can watch us online on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FollyBeachBaptistChurch/).

We hope to see you soon!

**He Is Able,**  
Pastor Clark Carter
