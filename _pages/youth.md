Our purpose is to empower students 6th through 12th grade to confidently navigate the challenges of the world and shine as a beacon of
light within it. We are committed to creating an environment that deeply honors God and welcomes
all students at any stage of their faith journey. Our teachings are firmly rooted in the Bible.
Our ultimate goal is to inspire students with the understanding that being a follower of Christ
means having a personal relationship with Him through daily prayer and devotion. We meet each
**Sunday at 5:00pm** with drinks and snacks in the Fellowship Hall. We are also involved in missions, outreach, camps and
retreats! If you have any questions feel free to [contact](ourleaders.md) Youth Pastor Billy Smith at **843-460-7737 or Superdad8586@yahoo.com** .
