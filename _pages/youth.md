Our purpose is to empower the youth of Folly Beach Baptist Church, as well as anyone who walks
through our doors, to confidently navigate the challenges of the world and shine as a beacon of
light within it. We are committed to creating an environment that deeply honors God and welcomes
individuals at any stage of their faith journey. All our teachings are firmly rooted in the Bible.
Our ultimate goal is to inspire our youth with the understanding that being a follower of Christ
entails advancing a personal relationship with Him through daily prayer and devotion. We meet each
week with drinks and snacks in the Fellowship Hall. We are also involved in missions, outreach, camps and
retreats! If you have any questions feel free to [contact](ourleaders.md) Youth Pastor Billy Smith at **843-460-7737 or Superdad8586@yahoo.com** .
