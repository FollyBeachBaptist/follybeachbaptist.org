Operation Christmas Child demonstrated God's love in a tangible way. We pack shoebox gifts with
toys, school supplies and hygiene items for boys and girls ages 2-14. We pack items into boxes to be distributed
to children around the world. Check [here](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/operation-christmas-child/what-goes-in-my-shoebox-suggestions/)
