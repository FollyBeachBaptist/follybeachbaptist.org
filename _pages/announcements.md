August 24 - The Case for Christ

![Alt text](/assets/images/540x300.jpg)

In 1980, Lee Strobel’s award-winning investigative
reporting earned him a promotion to legal editor at the
Chicago Tribune. Things at home weren’t going nearly as
well. His wife Leslie’s newfound faith in Christ compelled
Lee to utilize his journalistic and legal training to disprove
the claims of Christianity—pitting his resolute atheism
against her growing faith.
Based on Strobel’s best-selling book of the same name,
THE CASE FOR CHRIST movie is a dramatic and heartfelt
telling of their compelling journey.
