 **GriefShare**    
 ![Alt text](/assets/images/GriefShare%20Picture.jpg)  
 
GriefShare is a 13-week, Christ-centered program that helps people apply Biblical principles as they deal with the emotions and life stresses following the death of a loved one. If you’ve experienced the recent loss of a family member or friend, suffered a miscarriage, or are still processing grief from a loss that happened some time ago—GriefShare is for you.   
    
Grief is a journey that shouldn’t be traveled alone. You may feel like no one understands and be tempted to isolate, but as counselor David Bueno Martin says, “Healing happens in the context of finding others who can help you.”  

A GriefShare support group is a safe, welcoming place where people understand the difficult emotions of grief. Since there are no neat, orderly stages of grief, you’ll learn helpful ways of coping with grief, in all its unpredictability—and gain solid support each step of the way.  

**A New GriefShare Group will begin 10:00am, September 17th, at Epworth United Methodist Church, 1540 Camp Road, James Island.
Please call our office at 843-588-9414 for more information.**
