"Love God Love His Church" donations go directly to maintaining our buildings, grounds and facilities. 

Donations can be given online by using
[this secure link](https://secure.myvanco.com/L-Z0TS/campaign/C-13R83), or by placing your gift in a
"Love God, Love His Church" envelope and placing it in the offering plate, or simply dropping a
check off by the church. Thank you for your support as we continue to be good stewards of the things with which God has entrusted us.
