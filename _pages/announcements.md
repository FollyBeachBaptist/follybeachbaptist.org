At our June 2024 business meeting, the church voted to move forward with the HVAC replacement for
the sanctuary at a cost of $175,738. As you know, we had to do this due to the damage to our current
units from the December 2023 nor'easter. The great news is that through generous gifts and donations
the Lord has already provided $45,269.85 toward the replaced costs!

Will you pray with us and ask the Lord to move in the hearts of his people to help us meet this need
so ministry will not be hindered at Folly Beach Baptist Church?

Donations for this project can be given online by using
[this secure link](https://secure.myvanco.com/L-Z0TS/campaign/C-13R83), by placing your gift in a
"Love God, Love His Church" envelope and placing it in the offering plate, or simply dropping a
check off by the church. Thank you for your support and let's see what God is going to do!
