The Folly Beach Historical Society and its Board of Directors has decided to open the Folly Beach Museum on Sunday, January 25th, from 10:00am to 2:00pm to make it convenient for our congregation to visit before or after our church services.  

The current exhibit is "Surfing on The Edge".  

This is a wonderful opportunity to see the collection of artifacts, photographs, documents, and personal stories about the history of surfing on Folly Beach.  
We at Folly Beach Baptist Church would like to thank Dave Miller, the Historical society and Board of Directors for this gracious invitation.
