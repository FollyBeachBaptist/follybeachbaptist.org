**Operation Christmas Child**  
Operation Christmas Child demonstrated God's love in a tangible way. We pack shoebox gifts with
toys, school supplies and hygiene items for boys and girls ages 2-14. We collect donations of items
and money from March through October and then purchase and pack items into boxes to be distributed
to children around the world. For additional information in contributing or volunteering, please
contact Danielle Willis at 843-224-0873. Check

for suggested gifts and prohibited items.

**Soup and Soul Ministry**  
Join us every Monday from October through May at noon in the Church Fellowship Hall for a hot bowl
or soup and friendship. Access is through the church parking lot on Indian Ave.

**Recovery in Christ**  
What is Christ-centered Recovery? Christ-centered recovery involves turning from our hurts, habits,
and hang-ups to the One Who gives abundant life----Jesus Christ.
Who needs recovery? Anyone whose relationship with God, family and others falls short of God's 
standards for our lives. In other words, we all do to some degree. We meet Thursdays at 6:30pm
in the education building at Folly Beach Baptist Church.
Access is through the office door located in the rear of the church on West Indian avenue. 
**Contact Pastor Billy Smith at 843-460-7737 or Superdad8586@yahoo.com** if you would like more information.
**2 Corinthians 5:17** "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away;
behold, the new has come."
