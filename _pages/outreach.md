**Operation Christmas Child**  
Operation Christmas Child demonstrated God's love in a tangible way. We pack shoebox gifts with
toys, school supplies and hygiene items for boys and girls ages 2-14. We collect donations of items
and money from March through October and then purchase and pack items into boxes to be distributed
to children around the world. For additional information in contributing or volunteering, please
contact Terry Smith at 843-534-6730. Check
[here](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/operation-christmas-child/what-goes-in-my-shoebox-suggestions/)
for suggested gifts and prohibited items.

**Soup and Soul Ministry**  
Join us every Monday from October through May at noon in the Church Fellowship Hall for a hot bowl
or soup and friendship. Access is through the church parking lot on Indian Ave.

**Recovery in Christ**  
If something has more control over you than you do over it, join us on Thursday evenings at 6:30 pm.
We meet in the "39 room" for guidance, comfort and fellowship. Please use the front church entrance
on Center Street. Contact Richard Summey at 843-793-8623 with any questions.

**Virtual Prayer Meeting**  
Wednesday night Hour of Power is a virtual prayer evening that occurs every Wednesday at 6:30 on

**Seafarer's Ministry**  
The FBBC parishioners knit or crochet caps for the International Seafarer's Ministry as Christmas
gifts. These gifts are provided to working men and women onboard ships at the Port of Charleston
along with a gospel tract.

**WMU**  
South Carolina WMU's vision statement is "empowering churches and believers to participate in
fulfilling the Great Commission." FBBC WMU provides various ministry activities throughout the year.
They are a multiple year holder of the Triple A award obtained by meeting a minimum of 37 objectives
