Operation Christmas Child demonstrates God's love in a tangible way. Shoe boxes are packed and shipped to boys and girls ages 2 to 14 around the world who may have never heard the Gospel message or the Christmas Story. The boxes contain Toys, School supplies, and Hygiene items. Gifts for the boxes are collected March through October, and packed into the boxes at our annual **Christmas At The Beach** OCC Packing party. This year's packing party will be November 16th, 5:00pm to 8:00pm in the Fellowship hall. For additional information in contributing or volunteering, please
contact Danielle Willis at 843-224-0873. Check

for suggested gifts and prohibited items.

<img width="640" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/390aed60-c616-40bb-98d4-ce618237ec99" />

What is Christ-centered Recovery? Christ-centered recovery involves turning from our hurts, habits,
and hang-ups to the One Who gives abundant life----Jesus Christ.
Who needs recovery? Anyone whose relationship with God, family and others falls short of God's 
standards for our lives. In other words, we all do to some degree.   
We meet **Thursdays at 6:00pm** in the education building at Folly Beach Baptist Church.  

Access is through the office door located in the rear of the church on West Indian avenue.   

**Contact Pastor Billy Smith at 843-460-7737 or Superdad8586@yahoo.com** if you would like more information.  

**2 Corinthians 5:17** "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away;
behold, the new has come."
