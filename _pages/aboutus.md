**Brief History**  
On July 15, 1945, Mrs. H.H. Brown of Folly Beach, S.C., presentd to Citadel Square Baptist Church, deeds for two lots on Center Street on Folly Beach.  On August 1, 1945, a committee was appointed by Citadel Square to supervise a Mission on Folly Island. Rev. W.E. Abrams was appointed Superintendent of CIty Missions on May 1, 1946.  On June 27, 1946, Rev. Abrams called a meeting of all Baptists on the island to discuss the prospects of a Baptist church being planted here.  The meeting was held in the Civic Club building and was attended by about a dozen people.  In 1946, the first services were held in the Methodist Church in the afternoon.  In September of 1946, Folly Beach Baptist was organized as a mission of the Citadel Square Baptist Church with approximately 35 members.  The first formal services were held in the new church building (current fellowship hall) on December 21, 1946, with Rev. Abrams preaching the sermon.  In less than a year, the congregation obtained a charter as an idependent church, becoming established on July 13, 1947.
